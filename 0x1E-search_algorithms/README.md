# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms
#### C | Algorithm

A search algorithm designed to solve a search problem.
Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within a particular data structure.
The appropriate search algorithm depends on the data structure being searched and knowledge
about the data

Search algorithms can be classified as:
1. Linear search: checks every record for the one assosiated with the target key.
2. Binary search: Targets the center of the search space while dividing the structure in half
> For binary search, the data structure needs to be sorted beforehand
3. Hashing: a technique used to organize and access elements in a data structure in such a way
that retrieval is quick and efficient.
> A hash function is used to map the data into an index in an array.
